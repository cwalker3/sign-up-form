# Sign-up Form
This project is a simple sign-up form using basic HTML, CSS, and Javscript. It is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s Intermediate HTML and CSS course. It is not designed to look nice on mobile but I did try to make it look good on different monitor resolutions.

It can be viewed [here](https://cwalker3.github.io/sign-up-form/).
